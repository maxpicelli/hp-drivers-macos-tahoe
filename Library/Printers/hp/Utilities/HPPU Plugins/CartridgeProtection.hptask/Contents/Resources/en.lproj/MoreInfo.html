<p>The Cartridge Protection feature allows you to permanently mark all cartridges used in your printer so that they cannot be used in any other printer. If a Protected Cartridge is inserted in another HP printer, the printer will not allow the use of that cartridge and there will be a message stating that it can only be used in the original printer.
</p>
<u>Protect against theft</u><br>
<p>Sometimes cartridges are removed from a printer to be used in another printer, and while this can be useful if you have more than one printer, it can also mean that someone can steal your cartridges and use them in their printer.
</p>
<u>Protect against counterfeiting</u><br>
<p>Counterfeiters sell used cartridges as if they were new. Counterfeiters cannot reuse a protected cartridge because it will not work in any other printer.
</p>
If your printer is in an environment where you would like to limit use of your cartridges to a specific printer, click on Enable Cartridge Protection.
