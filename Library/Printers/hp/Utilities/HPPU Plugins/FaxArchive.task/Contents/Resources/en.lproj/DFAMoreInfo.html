		<p>The Digital Fax Archiving pane is used to set up your HP device to send received black-and-white faxes directly to either a folder on a local or network host computer or to a specified email address. Not all HP device support archiving to email.</p>
		<p>Digital Fax Archiving only works for black-and-white faxes. Color faxes will always print out normally when received.</p>
		<p>Select the button that corresponds to how you would like to archive Faxes: Save to Folder or Forward to Email.</p>
		<p>For Save to Folder, click "Choose Folderâ€¦" to select the shared folder you wish to use to store received faxes. Type directly in the fields or navigate to the folder you wish to use. Depending on your specific device and the folder selected, you will have to enter the appropriate server and authentication information.</p>
		<p>Click the "Connect" button to mount the sharepoint on your computer allowing you to navigate to a sub-folder if desired.</p>
		<p>For Forward to Email, enter the recipient and the information for the outgoing email (SMTP) server you want your HP device to use. If you do not know this information, check with your network administrator or Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
		<p>To be notified when a fax is received on your computer, select the "Incoming Fax Notification: On" button.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT!</b> Save to Folder requires a shared folder. See the documentation for your computer to learn how to set up a shared folder.</p>
		<b>NOTE:</b> More options and advanced settings may be accessed using the Embedded Web Server in your HP device. Refer to the device documentation for more information.
