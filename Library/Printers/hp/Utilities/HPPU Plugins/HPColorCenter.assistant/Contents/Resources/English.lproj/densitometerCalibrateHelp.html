									From time to time the printer has to calibrate itself for printing on your paper. Calibration is used to put the printer into a stable and repeatable state with each kind of paper it &quot;knows&quot; about. Once the printer has been calibrated, it is ready to build a custom color profile for your paper, or to use the existing color profile with good results. You can always re-calibrate your printer with the same paper to re-establish its stable state, without having to build a new color profile for it. For the very best results you can also choose to re-calibrate and re-profile your printer and paper combination at any time after the initial calibration and profiling has been performed. The choice is entirely up to you.

									Once you have selected the paper type to be calibrated, the calibration process consists of the following steps:
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									1.	A calibration test chart is printed. This test chart contains patches with various amounts of each ink being used in  your printer, often referred to as an &quot;ink ramp&quot;, &quot;primary ramp&quot;, or &quot;density ramp&quot;. The patches will be measured (scanned) to determine two basic printing parameters (among other things): linearity and maximum density of each ink ramp. Linearity means that each successive patch in the series (ramp) corresponds to an equal increment in density (darkness). Maximum density simply means how dense (dark) each of the inks can get, or is allowed to get.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									2.	The printed test chart is allowed to dry for a preset amount of time. It is important to allow the chart to dry before measuring it, since small color changes can occur between when the ink is wet (just after printing), and when it is dry (the way the print will be seen normally). The dry time used depends on the paper type.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									3.	The test chart is measured (scanned) using the printer&apos;s built-in densitometer. A densitometer is an optical instrument that can determine the amount of light reflected from a color patch, which can in turn be related to the amount of ink on the paper.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									4.	The calibration parameters are calculated and stored. Based on the measurements collected from the test chart, the printer calculates the necessary correction factors to apply to its internal image processing pipeline, and stores them for future use. The next time you print on this kind of paper, each ink ramp will be linear and the maximum density will correspond to the desired one. These are the basic conditions that need to be fulfilled for the successful creation of a custom color profile for your paper, or for the use of an existing one.

							<tr>
								<td>
									Once calibration is complete, you can browse the list of all papers your printer &apos;knows&apos; about. For each paper, it lists the paper category or custom paper name, the calibration status, and the calibration date. If the calibration status of a certain paper reads &quot;OK&quot;, that means that the printer has recently been calibrated for this paper, which is ready for use. If the status reads &quot;Obsolete&quot;, that means that a calibration has been performed at least once, but it is not reliable anymore because too much time has passed, a printhead has been replaced or any other condition has changed. You should re-calibrate the printer for this paper to ensure best results. If the status reads &quot;Recommended&quot;, that means that no calibration has been performed yet. You should calibrate the printer for this paper to ensure best results.
