									Before you can use a new kind of paper with your printer you must tell it a few things about the paper, like the name that you want to use for it. The printer also has to calibrate itself for use with your new paper. Calibration is used to put the printer into a stable and repeatable state with each kind of paper it &quot;knows&quot; about. Once the printer has been calibrated, it is ready to build a custom color profile for your new paper. Later you can always re-calibrate your printer with the same paper to re-establish its stable state, without having to build a new color profile for it. For the best possible results you can also choose to re-calibrate and re-profile your printer and paper combination at any time after the initial calibration and profiling has been performed. The choice is entirely up to you.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Before calibrating the paper, choose a name and a type for it. You can choose any name you like, but it&apos;s probably a good idea to use the paper vendor&apos;s commercial name for the paper, or something closely resembling it. That way you will have no problem remembering what paper type the name refers to, later on.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									When choosing a type for your new paper, try to choose one resembling your actual paper type as closely as possible. The paper type determines the amount of ink to use and other basic printing parameters, so making a good choice here is fundamental to achieving good results later on. If you find that you cannot obtain satisfactory results, you can experiment with choosing different paper types for new paper names corresponding to the same paper, and use the one that works best.

Calibration is used to put the printer into a stable and repeatable state with each kind of paper it &quot;knows&quot; about.

									The calibration process consists of the following steps:
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									1.	A calibration test chart is printed. This test chart contains patches with various amounts of each ink being used in your printer, often referred to as an &quot;ink ramp&quot;, &quot;primary ramp&quot;, or &quot;density ramp&quot;. The patches will be measured (scanned) to determine two basic printing parameters (among other things): linearity and maximum density of each ink ramp. Linearity means that each successive patch in the series (ramp) corresponds to an equal increment in density (darkness). Maximum density simply means how dense (dark) each of the inks can get, or is allowed to get.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									2.	The printed test chart is allowed to dry for a preset amount of time. It is important to allow the chart to dry before measuring it, since small color changes can occur between when the ink is wet (just after printing), and when it is dry (the way the print will be seen normally). The dry time used depends on the paper type, which is one of the reasons it is important to make that choice as accurately as possible when adding a new paper.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									3.	The test chart is measured (scanned) using the printer&apos;s built-in spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is a precision instrument that can determine the exact composition of light reflected from a color patch. It splits the reflected light into different wavelength components, just as Newton&apos;s famous prism splits white light into the colors of the rainbow, and measures the strength of each component.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									4.	The calibration parameters are calculated and stored. Based on the measurements collected from the test chart, the printer calculates the necessary correction factors to apply to its internal image processing pipeline, and stores them for future use. The next time you print on this kind of paper, each ink ramp will be linear and the maximum density will correspond to the desired one. These are the basic conditions that need to be fulfilled for the successful creation of a custom color profile for your paper, or for the use of an existing one.

									You have successfully added a new paper type and calibrated it. The printer is now ready to create a custom color profile (ICC profile) for use with your paper, which will allow you to print on it with the best possible color accuracy. Alternatively, if you have an ICC profile for use with your paper from a different source such as an Internet download, you can use that too. While &quot;canned&quot; ICC profiles, such as the ones you download from the Web, can give you good results, the best possible results will normally be obtained with a custom generated profile.;
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Here are some of the differences between the two types of profiles:
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									- Custom color profiles are based on test targets and measurements from your individual printer, using your individual inks and paper, and in your individual environmental conditions. In principle this gives you the best possible color accuracy, since everything is customized for your system.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									- Generic or &quot;canned&quot; color profiles are made for your model of printer and inks and the type of paper you use, but not for your individual printer, inks, and paper. They are based instead on &quot;typical&quot; or average test targets and measurements representing the &quot;typical&quot; or average system. While this gives good results for an average system, there may be slight deviations between your system and the average one that these profiles cannot account for.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									- Custom color profiles are made with your printer&apos;s built-in profiling software, or with the software that you purchased as an accessory. While this software provides excellent results, it must necessarily make certain choices about how it creates profiles, in particular about how it does gamut mapping for the Perceptual rendering intent. Gamut mapping occurs when colors from a device with a given color gamut (the range of all colors a device can capture or produce), such as a digital camera or computer monitor, must be translated or mapped to a device with a different sized or shaped color gamut, such as a printer. Gamut mapping is more of an art than a science, and hence there are no right or wrong answers – only different ones.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									- Generic color profiles, e.g. the ones provided by paper manufacturers, may have been made with different profiling software that makes different choices about gamut mapping and other profile properties. While these choices are not necessarily worse or better than the ones made by your printer profiling software, they are likely to be different.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Here are some guidelines to help you choose between profile types:
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									- If you are mainly interested in the color accuracy of your prints, for instance to make proof prints, you will likely use the Colorimetric rendering intent. The latter attempts to reproduce colors within the gamut of your printer with the greatest accuracy, possibly to the disadvantage of colors outside the printer gamut (which also have to be printed, one way or another). Since colorimetric reproduction is a more objective task than perceptual reproduction, there is less difference possible among profiling software, and a custom profile is normally your best bet.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									- If you are mainly interested in the &quot;look&quot; of your prints and good correspondence to your computer monitor, for instance for photographic and artistic applications, you will likely use the Perceptual rendering intent. Custom profiles are a great place to start since they are built with excellent color accuracy and a good looking Perceptual intent, but you may find that you prefer the look of certain third-party profiles.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Regardless of which profile type you end up using, remember that you can &quot;tweak&quot; their color reproduction to some extent by using the printer driver&apos;s color adjustment controls.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									As usual, the best advice is to stick with what works best for you. Some experimentation may be necessary to find out.
