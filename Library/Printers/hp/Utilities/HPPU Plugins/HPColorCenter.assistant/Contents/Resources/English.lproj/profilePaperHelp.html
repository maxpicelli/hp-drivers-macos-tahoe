									<p>The printer offers four different actions for profiling, and the workflow will change according to the selected action.</p>
									
									<h4>Create ICC profile/Print and Scan ICC profiling chart and create ICC profile</h4>
									
									<p>If you are working with predefined standard paper types under normal environmental conditions, you will probably want to use the all-in-one process. It will take a while to complete, but your printer will take care of all the operations needed in the correct order and with the required waiting time in between, to let the ink dry before measuring the chart.</p>

									<p>Test charts used for printer calibration and profiling are measured (scanned) using the printer's built-in spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is a precision instrument that can determine the exact composition of light reflected from a color patch. It splits the reflected light into different wavelength components, just as Newton's famous prism splits white light into the colors of the rainbow, and measures the strength of each component. Like all precision instruments, the spectrophotometer itself needs to be calibrated and stabilized before making measurements, to ensure the maximum accuracy possible. Calibration happens automatically, using a built-in white reference tile. Stabilization is ensured by switching on the spectrophotometer's built-in light source and letting it warm up for a short time before making measurements. A progress bar is displayed while this is happening.</p>
									
									<p><strong>What happens in the printer?</strong><br>
									First, the test chart is printed. After that, both the paper and the spectrophotometer (mounted on the printer carriage) are moved to position the latter over the color patches to be measured. Although measurement is done in stop motion (without the sensor or paper moving), the process is quite fast, averaging about 5 measurements per second. Measurement time for each patch is adapted automatically to the color being measured, since dark colors need a longer integration time (measurement period) than light colors, for best results. A progress bar is displayed during chart measurement (scanning).</p>

									<p>Since the measurements and hence the ICC profile precisely reflect what is 'seen' on the paper, and what is seen on the paper depends on many factors such as printer, inks, paper, print settings, and environmental conditions, the resulting profile can only be as 'good' or representative as the printing conditions are 'good' or representative. In other words, make sure that the test chart is being printed under conditions that are as similar as possible to the conditions you will use for making final prints using the resulting profile.</p>
									
									<p>If you happen to detect anomalies of print quality, paper defects, or other non-standard conditions while the chart is being printed, abort the process using the 'Cancel' button, and start again. Otherwise the resulting profile may not be representative of your typical printing conditions, and may not be very useful at all.</p>

									<p>Lastly, the HP Color Center automatically installs the profile in the computer that launched the process. If you are using your printer from another computer, remember to synchronize papers before moving forward. The process is now complete.</p>
									
									<h4>Create ICC profile/Print ICC profiling chart</h4>

									<p>This option provides you with the possibility to print only the target and complete the profiling process later. Furthermore, you could use the printed target using an external spectrophotometer for profiling.<br>
									Please refer to the first option for a detailed description of the profile creation process.</p>
									
									<h4>Create ICC profile/Scan ICC Profiling chart and create ICC profile</h4>

									<p>Your printer can create an ICC profile from a target that has already been printed. Please have ready an earlier printed target when selecting this option.<br>
									Please refer to the first option for a detailed description of the profile creation process and the following steps.</p>
									
									<h4 id="Step4">Install ICC Profile/Select the ICC profile you want to install</h4>

									<p>This option allows you to install and link an ICC profile to your paper that has been created outside of the printer, that you have downloaded from the Internet or that you have bought elsewhere.</p>
									
									<p>Steps to follow:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Click on the browse button in order to select the file containing the ICC profile you would like to install</li>
									</ul>

									<p>The ICC profile name will show up in applications such as Adobe Photoshop. The paper preset name will show up in the printer driver and the front panel. For the profile name it is recommended to use a combination of the printer model and the paper preset name. For example:<font color = red>"HP Z3200 Fine Art Pearl".</font></p>
									<p>As well, in papers that support gloss enhancer, decide to enable or disable it.</p>
