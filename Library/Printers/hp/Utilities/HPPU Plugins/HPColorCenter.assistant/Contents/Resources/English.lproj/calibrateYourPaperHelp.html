									Your printer comes with a wide range of paper presets covering a lot of different papers. However, in order to get the best quality and the best printing results, it is necessary to calibrate and profile the paper you are using with your printer. The printer adapts its general settings to the characteristics of the paper and creates an ICC profile that will be linked to the paper you are using during this process. This guide will lead you through the different steps and options available.

									<p>Type the paper name that you want to use. This new paper will appear in the Custom paper list. You are recommended to include some characteristics of the paper in the name so that you will be able to recognize it easily.<br>
									The next step is to select the paper type. This selection is one of the most important steps and determines the number of basic parameters for the printer-paper interaction. Please consult the document "Working with other commercially-available paper" (section "Front Panel &amp; Driver selection") for any doubts you might have concerning this selection. You can change the following printing properties: Paper Thickness (the distance between the carriage and the paper), Dry Time, Ink Limits (maximum density and color transition linearity threshols), Gloss Enhancer Level and Cutter. The following explanations give you a more detailed picture of the different options:</p>
									
									<p><strong>PAPER THICKNESS:</strong> You can feed thick and/or fairly rigid substrates up to 0.8 mm (~ 31 mils) through either the roll or sheet load path, but you cannot print on totally rigid materials such as aluminum, plastic, or other materials that are not compatible with aqueous pigmented inks.</p>

									<p><strong>DRY TIME:</strong> In order to customize your dry time selection for each paper, you can select None, Reduced, Optimal or Extended dry time.</p>

									<p><strong>INK LIMITS:</strong> Indicates the total amount of ink the paper can absorb to maximize gamut without causing image-quality problems. This setting is expressed in pico-liters (or nano-grams) per 1/600th × 1/600th inch paper area (divide by 4 for 1/1200th by 1/1200th inch area). In general, the higher the ink limit, the higher the gamut.</p>
									
									<p>How does it work?<br>
									The default value of the ink limit property is 100%, which means "all the ink" for that paper. This value can be modified down to 1% and up to 120%.<br>
									In order to understand what the ink limit does, it is important to understand what the color calibration does, as both are related.<br>
									The color calibration linearizes the response curve of the ink dropped on the paper (per colorant) versus the density. At the start point of this modified curve there will be no density (or no ink) and at the end point there will be the maximum allowed density – A constant value defined for each paper.<br>
									The ink limit affects the maximum density and the behavior of the color calibration. It is important to note that:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>After modifying the ink limit, the printer must be recalibrated in order to make the change take effect. Any existing calibration will be made obsolete automatically.</li>
										<li>The maximum allowed density is a constant value for a given paper and ink; so, if it is not achieved in the calibration process, modifying the ink limit can be useless. This can happen when loading with an incorrect paper selection (e.g. loading a coated paper as a glossy paper).</li>
										<li>There is no sense in modifying the ink limit for papers that cannot be calibrated (e.g. plain paper).</li>
										<li>The effect is different for each color / paper. Some colors are modified more than others; depending on the paper.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p><strong>GLOSS ENHANCER LEVEL:</strong> Gloss Enhancer is used essentially to ensure uniform area coverage across the printed page (i.e. more where other inks are used less), which results in the total elimination of issues like gloss differential and bronzing.<br>
									Indicates whether HP Gloss Enhancer can be used (applies to Glossy, Semi-gloss/Satin finishes)</p>

									<p><strong>CUTTER:</strong> Indicates whether cutting will be performed. Even if "Yes" is selected, cutting can be disabled later through the driver. However, if "No" is selected, cutting cannot be re-enabled through the driver.</p>

									<p>The printer offers four different actions for profiling, and the workflow will change according to the selected action.</p>
									
									<h4>Create ICC profile/Print and Scan ICC profiling chart and create ICC profile</h4>
									
									<p>If you are working with predefined standard paper types under normal environmental conditions, you will probably want to use the all-in-one process. It will take a while to complete, but your printer will take care of all the operations needed in the correct order and with the required waiting time in between, to let the ink dry before measuring the chart.</p>

									<p>Test charts used for printer calibration and profiling are measured (scanned) using the printer's built-in spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is a precision instrument that can determine the exact composition of light reflected from a color patch. It splits the reflected light into different wavelength components, just as Newton's famous prism splits white light into the colors of the rainbow, and measures the strength of each component. Like all precision instruments, the spectrophotometer itself needs to be calibrated and stabilized before making measurements, to ensure the maximum accuracy possible. Calibration happens automatically, using a built-in white reference tile. Stabilization is ensured by switching on the spectrophotometer's built-in light source and letting it warm up for a short time before making measurements. A progress bar is displayed while this is happening.</p>
									
									<p><strong>What happens in the printer?</strong><br>
									First, the test chart is printed. After that, both the paper and the spectrophotometer (mounted on the printer carriage) are moved to position the latter over the color patches to be measured. Although measurement is done in stop motion (without the sensor or paper moving), the process is quite fast, averaging about 5 measurements per second. Measurement time for each patch is adapted automatically to the color being measured, since dark colors need a longer integration time (measurement period) than light colors, for best results. A progress bar is displayed during chart measurement (scanning).</p>

									<p>Since the measurements and hence the ICC profile precisely reflect what is 'seen' on the paper, and what is seen on the paper depends on many factors such as printer, inks, paper, print settings, and environmental conditions, the resulting profile can only be as 'good' or representative as the printing conditions are 'good' or representative. In other words, make sure that the test chart is being printed under conditions that are as similar as possible to the conditions you will use for making final prints using the resulting profile.</p>
									
									<p>If you happen to detect anomalies of print quality, paper defects, or other non-standard conditions while the chart is being printed, abort the process using the 'Cancel' button, and start again. Otherwise the resulting profile may not be representative of your typical printing conditions, and may not be very useful at all.</p>

									<p>Lastly, the HP Color Center automatically installs the profile in the computer that launched the process. If you are using your printer from another computer, remember to synchronize papers before moving forward. The process is now complete.</p>
									
									<h4>Create ICC profile/Print ICC profiling chart</h4>

									<p>This option provides you with the possibility to print only the target and complete the profiling process later. Furthermore, you could use the printed target using an external spectrophotometer for profiling.<br>
									Please refer to the first option for a detailed description of the profile creation process.</p>
									
									<h4>Create ICC profile/Scan ICC Profiling chart and create ICC profile</h4>

									<p>Your printer can create an ICC profile from a target that has already been printed. Please have ready an earlier printed target when selecting this option.<br>
									Please refer to the first option for a detailed description of the profile creation process and the following steps.</p>
									
									<h4 id="Step4">Install ICC Profile/Select the ICC profile you want to install</h4>

									<p>This option allows you to install and link an ICC profile to your paper that has been created outside of the printer, that you have downloaded from the Internet or that you have bought elsewhere.</p>
									
									<p>Steps to follow:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Click on the browse button in order to select the file containing the ICC profile you would like to install</li>

							<tr>
								<td>
									<p>In this step, you must specify the following ICC profile settings:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The name of the ICC profile to be created.</li>
										<li>Gloss Enhancer On/Off if applicable.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>The name will be used for two related but different purposes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The filename that you will see when using your operating system's file browser to browse to the file containing the ICC profile. The file name extension ".icc" will be appended automatically to the profile name by the application so both you and your software will be able to recognize ICC profiles as such by looking at the extension.</li>
										<li>The profile's internal description string. Every ICC profile has an internal description string which is used by some (but not all) ICC-aware software to identify the profile, or to let you choose it from a list.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>Depending on the circumstances, you may see either the filename or the internal descriptor, which is why it is a good idea to use the same for both. Although in principle you can choose any name you like, it is good practice to define a standard naming convention for profiles, and to stick to it. For example, you can use the following name components, separated either by spaces, underscores, or other symbols of your choosing:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The printer type or name, for instance "HP Designjet Z2100" where "HP" represents the manufacturer (Hewlett-Packard), "Designjet" represents the series, and "Z2100" is the model number of your printer. Since both filename and internal descriptors are limited in length, you will probably need to abbreviate all this information into a single string of relatively few characters. Using the printer model as the first part of the profile name will ensure that all profiles for your printer will show up as a single consecutive group in both file browsers and application profile listings.</li>
										<li>The paper type or name, for instance "HWT310" for Hahnemühle Digital FineArt, ArtLine, Mould Made William Turner 310 gsm. As for the printer type or name, you will probably have to abbreviate the paper type or name. Make sure to use a unique name or abbreviation for each different paper type you use, so you will have no problem distinguishing the different profiles.</li>
										<li>The print quality and other settings you used for printing the test chart, for instance "B" for "Best" print quality or "BGE" for "Best" print quality and "Gloss Enhancer" enabled (only for photo type papers). Simplify and abbreviate as much as possible, but no more.</li>
										<li>The test chart used, for instance "Small" or "Large" or a particular test chart name such as "ECI2002" if/when those options are available. Simplify and abbreviate as appropriate.</li>
										<li>Some examples of profile names constructed under these guidelines would be "HP Designjet Z2100 HWT310" or "HP Designjet Z2100, Coated Paper", for instance. The corresponding file names would be "HP_Z2100_HWT310.icc" or "HP_Z2100_CoatedPaper.icc".</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>Regardless of which particular naming method you end up using, make sure that you can unambiguously distinguish the profiles for all the different paper types and other settings you are or will be using.<br>
									As usual, the best advice is to stick with what works best for you. Some experimentation may be necessary to find out.<br>
									Before continuing make sure you have the appropriate kind of paper loaded in your printer, and the printer is ready to print.</p>

									<p>The printer will then perform the color calibration (maximum density and linearity for each ink) and color profiling (creating an ICC profile) for the paper, which will ensure the best possible output quality.<br>
									If you are using your printer from another computer, remember to synchronize papers before moving forward. The process is now complete.</p>

									<p>Calibrating the printer and profiling paper types are two different steps that should not be confused. While calibrating your printer, a chart with lines and colors is printed and scanned by the printer. The number of colors depends on the number of different inks the printer has. The calibration is done by measuring the ink density. It ensures repeatability of the results. Each time you print the same file using the same printer, the same ink and the same paper the results will be the same.</p>

									<p>Calibration is the basis for the next step: profiling the combination of printer and paper. You can calibrate your printer without profiling it, but you cannot profile the printer without having calibrated it. The profiling process also includes the printing of a chart with different colors and patterns. However, in this case a spectrophotometer is used to measure the color accuracy of the output. A color profile can provide color accuracy for a given combination of the printer, the ink and the paper as long as other environmental factors such as humidity or heat do not change much.</p>

									<p>The calibration of the printer includes the following steps:</p>

									<p>1. A calibration test chart is printed.<br>
									This test chart contains patches with various amounts of each ink being used in your printer, often referred to as an "ink ramp", "primary ramp" or "density ramp". The patches will be measured (scanned) to determine two basic printing parameters (among other things): linearity and maximum density of each ink ramp. Linearity means that each successive patch in the series (ramp) corresponds to an equal increment in density (darkness). Maximum density simply means how dense (dark) each of the inks can get, or is allowed to get.</p>

									<p>2. The printed test chart is allowed to dry for a preset amount of time.<br>
									It is important to allow the chart to dry before measuring it, since small color changes can occur between when the ink is wet (just after printing), and when it is dry (the way the print will be seen normally). The dry time used depends on the paper type.</p>

									<p>3. The test chart is measured (scanned) using the printer's built-in spectrophotometer.<br>
									A spectrophotometer is a precision instrument that can determine the exact composition of light reflected from a color patch. It splits the reflected light into different wavelength components, just as Newton's famous prism splits white light into the colors of the rainbow, and measures the strength of each component.</p>

									<p>4. The calibration parameters are calculated and stored.<br>
									Based on the measurements collected from the test chart, the printer calculates the necessary correction factors to apply to its internal image processing pipeline, and stores them for future use. The next time you print on this kind of paper, each ink ramp will be linear and the maximum density will correspond to the desired one. These are the basic conditions that need to be fulfilled for the successful creation of a custom color profile for your paper, or for the use of an existing one.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>If you are mainly interested in the color accuracy of your prints, for instance to make proof prints, you will probably use the Colorimetric rendering intent. The Colorimetric rendering intent attempts to reproduce colors within the gamut of your printer with the greatest accuracy, possibly to the disadvantage of colors outside the printer gamut (which also have to be printed one way or another). Since colorimetric reproduction is a more objective task than perceptual reproduction, there is less difference possible among profiling software, and a custom profile is normally your best bet.</li>
										<li>If you are mainly interested in the "look" of your prints and a good match with your computer monitor, for instance for photographic and artistic applications, you will probably use the Perceptual rendering intent. Custom profiles are a great place to start since they are built with excellent color accuracy and a good-looking Perceptual intent, but you may find that you prefer the look of certain third-party profiles. Regardless of which kind of profile you end up using, remember that you can "tweak" their color reproduction to some extent by using the printer driver's color adjustment controls.</li>
										<li>If you want to use soft proofing in your applications, to simulate on screen what the printed output will look like, you should use application color management with ICC profiles. Profiles are bi-directional and contain the necessary information for converting application to printer colors (the inverse direction) and printer to application colors (the forward direction).</li>
										<li>If your application does not provide soft proofing capabilities, but you would still like to simulate on screen what the printed output will look like, try the HP Print Preview application. You can launch it from your printer driver (the PDF drop-down menu under Mac OS, or "show print in preview" under Windows).</li>
										<li>If you want fine control over how colors are rendered on your printer and paper, you will probably want to use application color management. Applications such as Photoshop allow you to convert an original RGB image into its printer- and paper-dependent representation (whether RGB or CMYK), turn on soft proofing to get an on-screen simulation of the printed result, and use a host of editing tools to modify the device color values before the image is printed. While this allows for very sophisticated control over printed color, it is not for the faint of heart and will require quite a bit of practice to get the results you want. If you want great-looking results without the hassle, try printer color management first.</li>
										<li>If your workflow is built around the use of ICC profiles, you will probably want to use application color management with printer ICC (ColorSync) profiles. If ICC doesn't mean anything to you, or you have no other use for ICC profiles, try printer color management first.</li>
										<li>If you work with non-standard paper types and/or environmental conditions, your best option is to generate custom ICC profiles using your printer's built-in spectrophotometer and profiling software. Since the profiling software currently generates ICC profiles but not proprietary color maps, you will probably want to use application color management.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>Whichever option you end up using, make sure you know which one you are using and why. Also make sure that your application and printer driver are configured correctly. The way to do application color management configuration depends on the application(s) you are using, and unfortunately there are no generally valid recipes. You may find the HP Printing Knowledge Center useful to assist with this task. It has detailed information on how to configure some of the most common professional graphics applications, as well as troubleshooting and other info.</p>
